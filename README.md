Came to the decision that having a separate index and home page was useless as the home page acts as an index of sort.

Created a simple navigation bar with elements on the left along with the French flag and footer with some further links, the map asked for, and a couple references, decide to make these two elements in Bordeaux-red

Originally designed banner with map but found that a more appropriate place for the map in the footer, so decided to add a couple widgets of grapes and a bottle instead

For the Visit page separated visiting locations into different sections which i though would be a good idea to separate into tabs for readability


The major challenge that I have faced is finding a professional-ish looking colour scheme, in the end I opted for using darker colours and reducing the opacity 

The second was getting git to work correctly with codio, the solution turned out to be linking github to actual codio account and not just the codio project as I was getting denied permission to push changes

Another challenge faced was getting the website to look good on both desktop and mobile. I have been able to get them to work but still doesn't look nearly as good on mobile.
